## ‚ùì What is an HTTP Method?

An **HTTP method** defines the type of action a client (usually a browser or app) wants to perform on a server's resource (like data in a database). These methods are part of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of data communication on the web.

Each method describes a specific intent:

- **GET** ‚Äì Retrieve information (e.g., list of users)
- **POST** ‚Äì Create a new resource (e.g., register a new user)
- **PUT** ‚Äì Replace an existing resource (e.g., update user profile)
- **DELETE** ‚Äì Remove a resource (e.g., delete a user)

When you interact with a website or an API, you're almost always using one of these methods under the hood.
